If\n// the union of these alternative subsets is a singleton, then no amount of\n// more lookahead will help us. We will always pick that alternative. If,\n// however, there is more than one alternative, then we are uncertain which\n// alternative to predict and must continue looking for resolution. We may\n// or may not discover an ambiguity in the future, even if there are no\n// conflicting subsets this round.</p>\n//\n// <p>The biggest sin is to terminate early because it means we've made a\n// decision but were uncertain as to the eventual outcome. We haven't used\n// enough lookahead. On the other hand, announcing a conflict too late is no\n// big deal; you will still have the conflict. It's just inefficient. It\n// might even look until the end of file.</p>\n//\n// <p>No special consideration for semantic predicates is required because\n// predicates are evaluated on-the-fly for full LL prediction, ensuring that\n// no configuration contains a semantic context during the termination\n// check.</p>\n//\n// <p><strong>CONFLICTING CONFIGS</strong></p>\n//\n// <p>Two configurations {@code (s, i, x)} and {@code (s, j, x')}, conflict\n// when {@code i!=j} but {@code x=x'}. Because we merge all\n// {@code (s, i, _)} configurations together, that means that there are at\n// most {@code n} configurations associated with state {@code s} for\n// {@code n} possible alternatives in the decision. The merged stacks\n// complicate the comparison of configuration contexts {@code x} and\n// {@code x'}. Sam checks to see if one is a subset of the other by calling\n// merge and checking to see if the merged result is either {@code x} or\n// {@code x'}. If the {@code x} associated with lowest alternative {@code i}\n// is the superset, then {@code i} is the only possible prediction since the\n// others resolve to {@code min(i)} as well. However, if {@code x} is\n// associated with {@code j>i} then at least one stack configuration for\n// {@code j} is not in conflict with alternative {@code i}. The algorithm\n// should keep going, looking for more lookahead due to the uncertainty.</p>\n//\n// <p>For simplicity, I'm doing a equality check between {@code x} and\n// {@code x'} that lets the algorithm continue to consume lookahead longer\n// than necessary. The reason I like the equality is of course the\n// simplicity but also because that is the test you need to detect the\n// alternatives that are actually in conflict.</p>\n//\n// <p><strong>CONTINUE/STOP RULE</strong></p>\n//\n// <p>Continue if union of resolved alternative sets from non-conflicting and\n// conflicting alternative subsets has more than one alternative.
